#### Who is this guy?

Well, my name is Nathan and I live in a town called Swindon in the UK.  I'm pictured with my lovely wife on holiday in sunny Wales.

I work as an Azure site reliability engineer these days, working with Terraform, AZ CLI, and Azure DevOps.  It's quite fun really.  In my 20 year career I've done a number of roles and have picked up a varied skillset throughout my storied path.  Recently I worked to improve performance and stability, as well as solve problems, in a multi-tiered Windows server estate.  My toolkit consisted of Perfmon, WireShark, and various SysInternals tools (vmmap, procmon etc).

Outside of work, I love dev work and am the sole developer of a fully automated NFL predictions game.  The site is written in Django and VueJS and makes use of things like Celery and Redis, while calling on an ESPN API for data.

When I'm not sat at a computer I like to keep fit down my local gym and can sometimes be seen monkeying around at my local Ninja Warrior training gym.
